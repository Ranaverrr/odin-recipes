        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>While the Filipino adobo and Spanish style adobo share vinegar and garlic, they are culturally distinct dishes with different ingredients and culinary traditions.[18] Unlike the Spanish and Latin American adobo, the main ingredients of Philippine adobo are ingredients native to Southeast Asia, which include vinegar (made from palm sap or sugarcane), soy sauce (typically substituting salt), black peppercorns, and bay leaves (traditionally Cinnamomum spp. leaves; but in modern times, usually Laurus nobilis). Unlike Spanish and Latin American adobo, Philippine adobo does not traditionally use chilis, paprika, oregano, or tomatoes. Instead, they only share similarities in their primary use of vinegar and garlic. Philippine adobo has a characteristically salty and sour, and often sweet taste, in contrast to Spanish and Mexican adobos, which are spicier or infused with oregano.</p>
